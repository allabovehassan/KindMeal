        <h3>What is KindMeal?</h3>
        <p>
          KindMeal is Malaysia's (and possibly the world's!) pioneering
          meat-free lifestyle platform. We provide an effective platform to
          promote compassionate dining in a fun and effective way, that would
          allow you to save precious animal lives, improve your health, enjoy a
          cleaner environment and of course, save your hard-earned money
        </p>
        <h3>What is Meat-Free?</h3>
        <p>
          Meat-free means that the food does not contain any meat, or
          ingredients derived from meat. However, it may contain some elements
          that people of certain diet do not consume, such as eggs, dairy /
          milk, or alcohol. Please refer to the details within each specific
          shop / deal for further information.
        </p>
        <h3>How do I sign up to KindMeal? Is it free?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, it is absolutely free. To join our community of food lovers and
          grab awesome deals, please sign up here.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are a merchant that wish to promote your business for FREE,
          please proceed to our Businesses Page.
        </p>
        <h3>What is a Username?</h3>
        <p>
          A Username is a nickname exclusively used to identify your profile. It
          will be used to access your Public Page, such as
          https://KindMeal.my/MyUsername, and it will also be displayed when you
          share KindMoments, comments and reviews.
        </p>
        <h3>How do KindMeal deals work?</h3>
        <p>
          Restaurants create attractive deals within KindMeal, which you can
          obtain coupons for. Our coupons differ from other conventional deal
          sites in that you do not need to make any upfront payment at KindMeal,
          and you can easily present our LiveCoupon via computer, mobile or
          laptop without any print coupons. For restaurants that do not require
          advance reservations, you can even use the LiveCoupon immediately!
          After all, eating is an impulsive decision, right?
        </p>
        <h3>How do I get a KindMeal coupon?</h3>
        <p>
          Just browse to a deal you like, select the corresponding outlet
          location (if the restaurant has multiple locations), then click on Get
          Coupon. Please note that the outlet location cannot be changed after
          the coupon is obtained.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each member is limited to 5 active coupons only. You must use the
          coupons before you can obtain additional ones. Unused coupons will
          automatically expire upon reaching its due date.
        </p>
        <h3>What is KindWords?</h3>
        <p>
          KindWords is a great way to tell your friends about the great food and
          instantly get more discount.
        </p>
        <p>
          For deals with KindWords enabled, you can enjoy DOUBLE the discount if
          you share the deal on Facebook or Twitter. Once you successfully share
          it, you will immediately receive the exclusive discount for your deal.
          If you prefer not to take advantage of KindWords, you can still
          proceed to get the deal at the normal discount price. Please note that
          not all deals support KindWords - it depends on the merchant.
        </p>
        <h3>How do I use my KindMeal LiveCoupon?</h3>
        <p>
          Once a coupon is received, you can access the LiveCoupon and use it
          via one of the following ways. An Internet connection is required.
        </p>
        <li>At KindMeal website, under Account - My Coupons section</li>
        <li>With our KindMeal mobile app, under Deals - My Coupons section</li>
        <p>
          You should only activate the LiveCoupon when you are at the
          restaurant, and upon informing the merchant. Some merchants may
          require that you activate it during the ordering process, while some
          will be during the payment process. Please inform the merchant first
          when you are ordering to ensure they are aware of your KindMeal
          LiveCoupon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once an active LiveCoupon is loaded, you will see a timer counting
          down the time remaining to use it. To activate it, click on Use
          LiveCoupon. Please ensure that you only activate it upon the request
          of the merchant. Activating it ahead of time may void your coupon and
          deal.
        </p>
        <h3>
          What if I don't have a mobile device or Internet connection, can I use
          a Print Coupon?
        </h3>
        <p>
          This depends on the specific deal. If the merchant allows it, you can
          also choose to print out the coupon and bring it along. Please refer
          to the deal's Terms & Conditions to check if print coupons are
          allowed, and if any prior reservation and usage delay are required.
        </p>
        <p>
          To print your coupon, first access it via KindMeal website at the
          Account->Account -> My Coupons section, then click on Print Coupon at
          the corresponding coupon. If the Print Coupon button is not available,
          it means that only LiveCoupons are accepted for the deal.
        </p>
        <h3>What is a Print Coupon's Usage Delay?</h3>
        <p>
          Some merchants may not have the facilities available to verify Print
          Coupons instantly, so they may impose a Usage Delay of a certain
          number of days to first print out a cross-checking reference list. If
          there is a 3-Day delay, it means that you can only use the Print
          Coupon 3 days after obtaining the coupon.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may wish to check with the merchant first before using it. We
          strongly suggest using a LiveCoupon instead, which is immediate with
          no usage delays.
        </p>
        <h3>How do I create a shop and offer deals?</h3>
        <p>
          You need to first sign up a merchant account. If you have an existing
          food lover account, we can upgrade it for you to enable the Merchant
          functions. To do so, please contact us and tell us more about your
          shop.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once your merchant account is activated, you can find out more details
          at the Merchant Help section.
        </p>
        <h3>Do I need to make any payments to get the deal coupons?</h3>
        <p>
          No, absolutely no payment is required at KindMeal to obtain your
          coupon. You will only need to make payment at the restaurant when you
          use the coupon to purchase your food.
        </p>
        <h3>What is a KindMoment?</h3>
        <p>
          A KindMoment is a food selfie, a photo moment of your delicious food
          for sharing with the world, and to encourage meat-free dining. Sharing
          a KindMoment is extremely quick and easy, similar to other social
          photo sharing websites or mobile apps.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you link your KindMeal account with Facebook, you can also
          automatically publish your latest KindMoments there. On top of that,
          you can also manually share on Facebook and Twitter.
        </p>
        <p>
          The public can like and comment on your KindMoments, and you can also
          edit the KindMoment after publication.
        </p>
        <h3>What is Food Menu?</h3>
        <p>
          Restaurants can additionally showcase meat-free dishes and menu items.
          These items are different from deals, and there may not be offers
          available for them. You can discover interesting new food through our
          menu listings, and browse the corresponding restaurants for more
          information. To search for specific types of food or restaurants, go
          to the search section at the bottom of the page. You can click on a
          menu item to launch the gallery, where you will have a quick view of
          the corresponding shop's details. Click into a specific
        </p>
        <h3>What are Superhero Rankings?</h3>
        <p>
          Superheroes save lives. So can you. By trying out meat-free meals,
          sharing delicious moments and encouraging friends to do so, you can
          earn yourself cool Superhero ranks on KindMeal and win awesome prizes!
